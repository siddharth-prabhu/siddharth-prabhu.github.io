I am a Ph.D. candidate in Chemical Engineering at [Lehigh University](https://engineering.lehigh.edu/chbe), working with [Dr. Kothare](https://engineering.lehigh.edu/faculty/mayuresh-v-kothare) and [Dr. Rangarajan](https://engineering.lehigh.edu/faculty/srinivas-rangarajan). My research has focused on:

- Constrained Nonlinear Optimization
- Parameter estimation of ordinary differential equations
- Physics informed machine learning of ordinary and partial differential equations
- Constrained differential dynamic programming for solving optimal control problems

Over the past two years, I have collaborated with Owens Corning on data-driven modeling of their drying unit operation. In this work, we develop a mechanistic model augmented with neural components to capture unknown or unmodeled physics. We train the combined model, including the neural network parameters, using experimental data. The learned model is then applied to optimize energy usage and to control. To support this research, I have also developed open-source software tools to ensure reproducibility and accessibility for the broader research community.

Currently, I am investigating data-driven approaches for online control of high-dimensional partial differential equations.

Outside of research, I enjoy reading (including manga), investing, and hiking.
