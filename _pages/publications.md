| <a href="/assets/images/BiLevel.png"><img src="/assets/images/BiLevel.png" height="300px" width="600px" alt=""></a> | **Siddharth Prabhu**, Srinivas Rangarajan, and Mayuresh Kothare. Bi-level optimization for parameter estimation of differential equations using interpolation, 2025. [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00720). [Code](https://github.com/siddharth-prabhu/BiLevelParameterEstimation) <br>
- Designed a bilevel optimization framework for parameter estimation that leverages the convexity of linear parameters in dynamical systems.
- Demonstrated superior performance of the proposed method over shooting-based techniques across multiple complex dynamical systems.|

An event-based neural partial differential equation model of heat and mass transport in an industrial drying oven. Computers & Chemical Engineering, page 109171, 2025. [Paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0098135425001759). [Code](https://github.com/siddharth-prabhu/EventODE). <br>
- Developed a fully differentiable physics-based simulator for Universal Partial Differential Equations (UPDE) to model noisy, partially observed dynamical systems with events.
- Demonstrated that incorporating physics-based priors enables effective learning from partially observed states and improves generalization to unobserved regions.|

A condensing approach to multiple shooting neural ordinary differential equation, 2025. [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00724). [Code](https://github.com/siddharth-prabhu/MS-NODE). <br>
- Developed an optimization method to incorporate equality constraints from multiple shooting into the training of Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (NODE).
- Demonstrated that the proposed approach achieves better performance on highly nonlinear, complex and oscillatory dynamics using fewer parameters compared to single shooting NODE.|

[Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/11108083). [Code](https://github.com/siddharth-prabhu/ConstraintDDP). <br>
- Developed and Interior Point Differential Dynamic Programming algorithm to incorporate stagewise arbitrary equality and inequality constraints in an optimal control problem.
- The algorithm outperforms nonlinear programming based methods on several benchmark problems such as car parking, obstacle avoidance, quadcopter, robot arm, quadcopter, continuously stirred tank reactor. |

[Code](https://github.com/siddharth-prabhu/ParameterEstimationConstraints).<br>
- Developed an integration-based technique for sparse identification of dynamical equations compatible with domain knowledge such as mass balance and chemical constraints.
